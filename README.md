# Mask-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Face Mask Detection based on Computer Vision and Deep Learning using OpenCV and Tensorflow. The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
